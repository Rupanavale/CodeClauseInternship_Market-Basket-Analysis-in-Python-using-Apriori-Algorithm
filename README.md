## Project Description
This repository contains a Python script that performs Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm on a retail dataset. The analysis aims to uncover associations and patterns in customer purchasing behavior, helping businesses make informed decisions to enhance their strategies.

## Introduction
Market Basket Analysis is a technique used to identify relationships between products that are frequently purchased together. This script utilizes the Apriori algorithm to analyze a retail dataset, finding associations between items and generating rules that highlight potential cross-selling opportunities.

## Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- mlxtend

## Usage
Clone this repository or download the script.
Make sure you have a retail dataset in Excel format (e.g., Online Retail.xlsx) with relevant columns such as 'InvoiceNo', 'Description', 'Quantity', etc.
Update the df = pd.read_excel("your_file_path.xlsx") line in the script to point to your dataset.
Run the script in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE).

## Results
The script performs the following steps:
- Loads the dataset and previews its structure.
- Handles missing values and canceled transactions.
- Filters data for a specific country (e.g., United Kingdom) and groups it by transaction and item.
- Encodes the data for analysis.
- Removes single-item invoices.
- Applies the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets.
- Generates association rules based on lift values.

## Conclusion
Market Basket Analysis offers valuable insights into customer behavior and product associations. The generated rules can guide strategic decisions, such as cross-selling and bundling strategies.
